This project enables you to dance with the Death itself, by scheduling a date with it.

You can pick any date in a year and schedule a date with Death. It relies on database and AJAX request to communicate with the CRUD API.

You can only schedule once a day during the office hours (Death is busy too!) and you can only dance with it for one hour (you will get tired if you schedule for longer, Death is too good of a dancer).

Go to ```/api/delete_all``` in order to delete all database entries.

It has a browser automation test file ```browser_testing.py``` which simulates the browser session on heroku.
